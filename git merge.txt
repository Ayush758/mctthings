 git code merge with confliction issue resolving ========
------ Create branch in local ------
git checkout -b gavin-lms-test (it will create branch and simultaneously get inside it )
git branch gavin-lms-test (it will create branch only )
------ Switch the branch ------
git switch gavin-lms-test
Recently created branch also created on git repo
git push -u origin gavin-lms-test
------ To resolve merge conflict ------
------ First of all we have to create Pull request/Merge request raised by GUI ------
------ If conflict happened so we need to pull code from main in VS code then resolve and again push ------
git fetch origin main
git pull origin main
------- After correct confliction changes -------
git push origin 'gavin-lms'
------ Delete any branch from CLI only ------
git branch -D gavin-lms-test
------ Delete branch from GUI also through CLI ------
git push origin --delete gavin-lms-test
