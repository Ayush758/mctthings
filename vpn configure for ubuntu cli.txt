:white_check_mark: Step-by-Step Guide to Connect to OpenVPN from AWS EC2 Ubuntu
1. Install OpenVPN
SSH into your AWS Ubuntu EC2 instance and install OpenVPN:
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvpn unzip -y
2. Upload or Extract VPN Files
Assuming you've already uploaded OpenVPN_Server_vikas (1).zip:
Unzip the file:
bash
unzip OpenVPN_Server_vikas\ \(1\).zip -d ~/vpnconfig
Check the contents:
bash
ls ~/vpnconfig
Look for a
.ovpn
 file (this is the client config file).
3. Modify the
.ovpn File (if required)
If authentication is via username and password, you must do this:
Create a file vpnlogin.txt:
bash
echo -e "vikas\nadmin" > ~/vpnconfig/vpnlogin.txt
Then edit the
.ovpn file (e.g., client.ovpn) to include:
bash
auth-user-pass vpnlogin.txt
If it's already there, just ensure it's pointing to the right file.
4. Connect to the VPN
Run the VPN client:
bash
sudo openvpn --config ~/vpnconfig/client.ovpn
If everything is set up properly, you should see logs like:
mathematica
Initialization Sequence Completed
5. Verify the VPN Connection
Open another terminal and run:
bash
curl ifconfig.me
