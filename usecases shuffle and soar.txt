Use Case 1: Auto-Isolate Host on High-Severity Alert
üîç Trigger:
Wazuh agent detects a high-severity alert (e.g., malware, privilege escalation, brute force).

üîÑ Shuffle Workflow:
Wazuh sends alert to Shuffle via webhook.

Shuffle parses the alert (e.g., CVSS score > 7 or rule ID match).

Run a command on the Linux agent to isolate the machine:

Disable network interfaces

Block all outgoing traffic via iptables or ufw

Notify SOC via Slack, email, or Teams.

üîß Tools Involved:
Wazuh REST API

Shuffle Linux or SSH app

Slack/Email app


=====================
Use Case 2: Unauthorized User Creation Detection
üîç Trigger:
Wazuh detects useradd or /etc/passwd modifications.

üîÑ Shuffle Workflow:
Fetch alert from Wazuh.

Verify user details and creation time.

Cross-check with change management/ticketing tool.

If unauthorized:

Remove the user account

Alert SOC

Run audit commands (last, who, w, etc.)

Generate report

Wazuh: Security detection (detects useradd or passwd changes)

Shuffle (192.168.100.32:3001): SOAR (orchestration and automation)

EventShield (192.168.100.60): Normalizes and forwards events from Wazuh

Your Workflow Goal: Automatically detect unauthorized user creation ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Take action ‚Üí Report
