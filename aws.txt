AWS Resource	Role
VPC	Your virtual network (like your own cloud data center)
Subnet	Logical partition inside a VPC (like connecting devices to a switch)
Route Table	Defines Layer 3 routing between subnets or to Internet
Security Group	Acts like a firewall for EC2 (not a switch but related)
NACL (Network ACL)	Stateless firewall at subnet level

There is no physical or configurable switch in AWS, but subnets inside a VPC behave like a
 switch â€” providing Layer 2 connectivity among instances.
