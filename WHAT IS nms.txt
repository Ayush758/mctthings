NMS software stands for Network Management System software. It's a type of software used by IT administrators to monitor, maintain, and optimize computer 
networks. Think of it as the central command center for keeping a network healthy, secure, and performing well.

What does NMS software do?
Here are some of its key functions:

Network Monitoring: Tracks the health, status, and performance of devices like routers, switches, firewalls, servers, and more.

Alerts & Notifications: Sends real-time alerts (email, SMS, etc.) when something goes wrong, like a device going offline or high bandwidth usage.

Configuration Management: Helps manage device settings and configurations across the network.

Performance Analysis: Tracks metrics like latency, packet loss, bandwidth usage, and uptime.

Fault Management: Detects, logs, and helps diagnose problems in the network.

Topology Mapping: Visually maps out the network so admins can see all devices and their connections.

Security Monitoring: Flags suspicious activity or unauthorized access attempts.

üîÅ Topology (in NMS)
Network topology refers to the layout of a network ‚Äî how all devices (routers, switches, servers, etc.) are connected.

In an NMS:

Topology maps are auto-generated visual representations of your network.

They help you see how devices are interconnected and identify issues like loops, broken links, or unauthorized devices.

Helps with troubleshooting and planning network expansion.

There are different types of topologies like star, ring, mesh, bus, but in NMS it‚Äôs usually shown as a logical or physical diagram.

üì° CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
A Cisco proprietary protocol.

Used to discover other Cisco devices on the same network.

Shares info like device ID, IP address, port, platform, and capabilities.

Useful for building accurate topology maps in networks that use Cisco gear.

üîç NMS tools use CDP to automatically detect network neighbors and create visual maps.

üåê LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol)
An open-standard protocol, similar to CDP, but works with non-Cisco devices (HP, Juniper, etc.).

Also shares device info (name, port, VLAN, etc.) to help identify and manage network connections.

üìä NMS tools use LLDP for multi-vendor network environments to auto-discover connections between devices.

üìÅ MIB file (Management Information Base)
A text file used by SNMP-based tools to understand and interpret the data from network devices.

Each network device (like a router or switch) can expose certain data through SNMP OIDs (Object Identifiers).

The MIB file defines what each OID means ‚Äî like "CPU usage", "interface status", "temperature", etc.

üõ†Ô∏è Without the correct MIB file, your NMS might just show a bunch of numeric OIDs with no meaning.

How they all work together in an NMS:
LLDP/CDP helps the NMS discover the network and map out device connections (topology).

MIB files help the NMS interpret device data collected via SNMP.

The NMS uses this info to build topology maps, track performance, and send alerts.
